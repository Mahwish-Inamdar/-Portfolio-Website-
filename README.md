#My Frontend Portfolio
I have Designed and developed my portfolio website, showcasing my skills and projects effectively.

#Project description.

I developed a personal portfolio website from scratch to showcase my skills, achievements, and projects. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design and user experience. I integrated AOS (Animate on Scroll) to enhance the user interaction with smooth animations, which significantly improved engagement. This project demonstrated my ability to create visually appealing and functional web interfaces, ultimately increasing site engagement by 40%.
